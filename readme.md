# wordle remake

so i have no projects on my resume other than minecraft servers and i dont know how appealing that looks to employers... so im giving this a try

this is like my first time using python in quite a while, ive been mostly focused on java so this might look horrible, i'll fix it up at some point

eventually, this will be put on a website to look better too instead of looking ugly in the terminal. ill also be coding some sort of AI to auto solve these because i get bored sometimes, not sure when that'll happen though

thanks!
